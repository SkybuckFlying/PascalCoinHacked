# Pascal Coin (Hacked): Clone of SkybuckFlying/PascalCoin with improvements to compile in Delphi XE

Also includes some binaries, exe, dlls everything that's needed to run PascalCoin.

This is a hacked version of PascalCoin. Run it on networks with most or high hashing power, after 100 blocks the safebox should be written
in such a way that all new/modified/affects accounts will be reset to 1.000.000 pascalcoins.

This software is an experiment to test the security of PascalCoin and to see how easy it is to "manipulate" the blockchain.

Run this software at your own risk !

It's highly recommended to "backup the data folder" first before attempting to run this software !
